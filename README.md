# HSML Web App

## File Structure

### Stylizing, Formatting


``static/css``: Our single CSS stylesheet. Use this to modify font, background, etc. across the entire web app.


``static/images``: Store relevant images (ex. NASA logo, our background) here, then pass the filepath as /static/images/yourImage.png in your code.
